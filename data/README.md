# Dataset of Telegram News Posts

For the Russian version of this dataset description, you can access it [here](README_ru.md).

## üóí Description

This dataset contains messages collected from various **Russian** news Telegram channels. It includes two types of files: a separate JSON file for each channel and a consolidated CSV file with all the data. All messages are classified into categories, making the dataset suitable for text classification tasks.

The classification was performed automatically using the **Qwen 2.5** model.

## üìù Data Structure

1. **Folder with JSON files**: Each file in the folder contains messages from one channel. The file name corresponds to the channel's ID, and its contents are in JSON format, with each object representing an individual post. Example file name: `{channel_id}_messages.json`. The structure of each message is as follows:

```json
{
    "message_id": 11655,
    "sender_id": -1001000724666,
    "text": "Post text",
    "date": "2024-11-07T18:09:50+00:00",
    "channel": "Channel name",
    "category": "category"
}
```

2. **CSV File**: All data from the JSON files are combined into a single CSV file, which includes information about each post, including the channel ID, post text, publication date, and category. The file name is `all_channel_posts.csv`.

Example CSV row:

```csv
message_id,sender_id,text,date,channel,category
11655,-1001000724666,"–î–µ—Ä–º–∞—Ç–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏ —É—Ç–æ—á–Ω–∏–ª–∏ –ø—Ä–∏—á–∏–Ω—É ¬´—Ä–∞–∫–∞ —Å–∞—Ä–∏¬ª —É –Ω–æ—Å—è—â–∏—Ö —ç—Ç—É –æ–¥–µ–∂–¥—É","2024-11-07T18:09:50+00:00","Naked Science","science"
